# Robotic-Transformations-and-Kinematics-Matrix-Representations-and-Joint-Angle-Calculations

This report covers robotic transformations and kinematics using homogeneous transformation matrices combining rotation (3×3) and translation (3×1). Rotation matrices for x, y, and z axes are detailed, including a z-axis rotation matrix using cosθ and sinθ. Euler angles describe orientation, supporting forward and inverse kinematics. Key problems solved include completing a frame matrix (nx=0, ny=1, nz=0), rotating a point by 30° (z-axis) and 60° (y-axis) to coordinates [2.53, 2.23, 1.62], and extracting Euler angles ϕ=35°, θ=50°, ψ=0° from a transformation matrix. A compound transformation involving translations and rotations (5 units translation, 60°, 60°, 45° rotations) results in position [3.8, 3.59, 5.71] and roll-pitch-yaw angles [74.8°, 17.8°, 21.8°]. For a 2-DOF robot with 1-ft links, joint angles θ1 ≈ -8° and θ2 ≈ 115° were computed via inverse kinematics. These illustrate practical use of matrix operations and trigonometry in robot kinematics.
